		<h2>Using the Maps Tool</h2>
		<p>
			Once the Maps tool is correctly <a href="content.hlp?docId=mtad">configured</a>, 
			the tool allows you to view the map and use your mouse to navigate it. The controls 
			on the left side allow you to to zoom in and out. You can click on markers to view their details. 
		</p>
		<h3>Creating, editing, and deleting markers</h3>
		<p>
			First of all, you need to have the appropriate permission to create or edit markers. If you 
			have the permission to <strong>create</strong> a marker, you also have permission to edit or 
			delete marker that you created. Create a marker by clicking on a point on the map. If you do not 
			have the <strong>create</strong> permission, clicking on the map will simply not show the marker 
			creation dialog. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			To <strong>edit</strong> a marker, lick on an existing marker and then click the edit 
			button. If this option is not available or grayed out, you do not have the permission to edit
			this marker.
		</p>
		<p>
			Markers need a name, and optionally a description, URL and marker type. Types can be configured 
			by an administrator on the <a href="content.hlp?docId=mtta">marker type administration</a> page. 
			If <strong>no types</strong> are configured, the default will be used and the selection box is 
			not displayed. If <strong>only one type</strong> is configured, that type will be used for all 
			new markers, and the selection box will not be displayed. If there are multiple types configured, 
			the option to select a type is available. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To <strong>delete</strong> a marker, click on the marker and use the delete option on the marker 
			details panel. If this option is unavailable or grayed out, you do not have the permission to delete 
			the marker.
