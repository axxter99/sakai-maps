		<h2>Maps: Marker Type Administration</h2>
		<p>
			If you have permissions to administer markers, the option <strong>marker types</strong> 
			(or the localized translation) will be available in the action bar on top of the maps tool. 
		</p>
		<h3>Marker types</h3>
		<p>
			It is not required to configure the marker types of the maps tool. If <strong>no types</strong> 
			are configured, a default type will be used. If <strong>only one type</strong> is configured, that 
			type will automatically be used for all new markers. If there are multiple types configured, user
			creating a new marker can choose a type.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating and editing marker types</h3>
		<p>
			The marker types can be defined using the list on the marker types administration page. A type 
			can be created by entering a label in the type name box. New types can be added by clicking the 
			plus (+) icon. Types can be ordered using the up an down arrows. The type color can be changed 
			using the drop down box.
		</p>
		<h3>Deleting a marker type</h3>
		<p>
			Marker types can be deleted, but only if the the type is not currently used in markers. The delete 
			icon will only be available if there are no markers that use the type. Before deleting a marker type, 
			you have to make sure that it is not in use. This can be done by either deleting the markers or 
			changing the type for these existing markers.
